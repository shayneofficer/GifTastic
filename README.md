# GifTastic

## About
Just a simple app to fetch Pokemon gifs using the Giphy API when a button is pressed. Buttons can also be added which then gain the same functionality. Gifs load in paused by default, then begin to animate when clicked (and pause when clicked again). 

## TODO
If I have time I'll add in some of the bonus features:
1. Ensure your app is fully mobile responsive.
2. Allow users to request additional gifs to be added to the page.
    - Each request should ADD 10 gifs to the page, NOT overwrite the existing gifs.
3. List additional metadata (title, tags, etc) for each gif in a clean and readable format.
4. Include a 1-click download button for each gif, this should work across device types.
5. Integrate this search with additional APIs such as OMDB, or Bands in Town. Be creative and build something you are proud to showcase in your portfolio
6. Allow users to add their favorite gifs to a favorites section.
    - This should persist even when they select or add a new topic.
    - If you are looking for a major challenge, look into making this section persist even when the page is reloaded(via localStorage or cookies).
